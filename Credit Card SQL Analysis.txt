I am working with Credit Card Dataset. Here I have performed Attrition Analysis for 25K Credit Card Users using SQL to get the insights related to churn rate across different countries.

1. To print the first ten entries to get an overview of data.

SELECT * FROM `creditcard` limit 10;


2. To find Customer Count from different countries

SELECT creditcard.Geography AS Country, COUNT(creditcard.Customer_ID) AS Customer_Count
FROM `creditcard` 
GROUP BY creditcard.Geography 
ORDER by Customer_Count DESC;


3. To find count of the top 5 occupations of customer who are existing customers

SELECT creditcard.Occupation AS "Type of Occupation", COUNT(creditcard.Status) AS Customer_Count
FROM `creditcard` 
WHERE creditcard.Status = "Existed"
GROUP BY creditcard.Occupation
ORDER by Customer_Count DESC
LIMIT 5;


4. Credit Card User Distribution that has exited based on Age

SELECT CASE WHEN creditcard.Age < 20 THEN "0-20"
WHEN creditcard.Age BETWEEN 20 AND 40 THEN "20-40"
WHEN creditcard.Age BETWEEN 40 AND 60 THEN "40-60"
WHEN creditcard.Age > 60 THEN "Above 60" END as Age_Range, COUNT(*) AS Customer_Count
from creditcard
WHERE creditcard.Status = "Attrited"
GROUP BY Age_Range;


5. Males Vs Females In Existing and Attrition customers

SELECT SUM(IF(Gender = "Male", 1, "NULL")) as MaleExistingCustomers, SUM(IF(Gender = "Female", 1, "NULL")) as FemaleExistingCustomers 
from creditcard
WHERE creditcard.Status = "Existed";

SELECT SUM(IF(Gender = "Male", 1, "NULL")) as MaleExistingCustomers, SUM(IF(Gender = "Female", 1, "NULL")) as FemaleExistingCustomers 
from creditcard
WHERE creditcard.Status = "Attrited";


6. Find the sum of attrited customer with payment status

SELECT SUM(IF(Payment_of_Min_Amount = "Yes", 1, "NULL")) as Paid_Payment, SUM(IF(Payment_of_Min_Amount = "No", 1, "NULL")) as Unpaid_Payment,  SUM(IF(Payment_of_Min_Amount = "NM", 1, "NULL")) as Unknown_Payment
from creditcard
WHERE creditcard.Status = "Attrited";
